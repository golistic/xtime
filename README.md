xtime - Extra Time Functionality
================================

Copyright (c) 2022, Geert JM Vanderkelen

`xtime` provides extra functionality related to time.
It extends whatever is provided by the [standard Go library][1], contains
no magic, and probably does offer not more than what can be found in various 
other projects.
